## Introduction
SNEE is a software package built largely on top of NetworkX and Matplotlib with a GUI implemented in Tkinter.  It is capable of a wide range of general social simulations that can take place over some attribute space (e.g. changing opinions, epidemics, information diffusion, etc.) or topologically.  The goal of SNEE is to provide an umbrella framework to support a majority of experiemental designs with respect to relevant simulations in a way that can be used by a general audience or by highly technical participants.
